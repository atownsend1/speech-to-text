So I'm not really thinking here, I am just saying. 3.14159265358.

00:08.000 --> 00:19.000
I can recite the first thousand digits or so in six minutes-ish, and then the next thousand digits, I was able to recite that in about 20 minutes.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Hi, my name is Annika and I'm a junior in bioengineering here at UMD.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
I've really liked challenging myself to memorize things.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
I remember my mother once spoke about someone who was able to memorize all the world capitals, and I was like, oh, that's cool, why don't I try that?

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
When I think about pi, you first have to structure it so that your brain can understand it.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
These blocks are thousands. You split it into ten fractions, and these are the hundreds.

00:54.000 --> 01:07.000
As opposed to trying to memorize things in one big sequence, I create a little matrix that I can individually put information in each one of those cells in my mind so I can recall it as I need to.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Then this hundred is split into tens, and then this ten is your digits.

01:13.000 --> 01:25.000
When you're studying for a spelling test, for example, would it be easier to remember the spelling of a hundred letter word, or ten letter words, and the order of ten of those in a sentence?

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
I don't just rote-memorize anything, because I feel like that is not quite as fun as finding patterns within the things you memorize.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
So all I have to do to memorize this one is remember, oh, seven and two is nine, I skip the next one, four and five is nine.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
This is almost like a sandwich. You just have to remember three, eight, four between the two ones.

01:48.000 --> 01:58.000
From one to one thousand, I can pinpoint any digit. So if you gave me like six hundred and eighty-seven, I'd be able to give you the six hundred and eighty-seven digit.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Being able to keep practicing that recall, I think, there are benefits of that, like, outside of just pi.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
And so it helps me in class, because then I can just recall information.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
My favorite number, over here, I don't think I have a supersonic brain.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
I think I have a pretty normal brain, but I've been able to kind of optimize these things.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I taught my friend how to memorize pi with the same explanation.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
He was able to get to 200 digits in four days as a beginner. It works.
