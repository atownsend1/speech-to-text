00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So I'm not really thinking here, I am just saying. 3.14159265358.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I can recite the first thousand digits or so in six minutes-ish, and then the next thousand digits, I was able to recite that in about 20 minutes.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hi, my name is Annika and I'm a junior in bioengineering here at UMD.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I've really liked challenging myself to memorize things.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I remember my mother once spoke about someone who was able to memorize all the world capitals, and I was like, oh, that's cool, why don't I try that?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When I think about pi, you first have to structure it so that your brain can understand it.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
These blocks are thousands. You split it into ten fractions, and these are the hundreds.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:07,000
As opposed to trying to memorize things in one big sequence, I create a little matrix that I can individually put information in each one of those cells in my mind so I can recall it as I need to.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then this hundred is split into tens, and then this ten is your digits.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When you're studying for a spelling test, for example, would it be easier to remember the spelling of a hundred letter word, or ten letter words, and the order of ten of those in a sentence?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't just rote-memorize anything, because I feel like that is not quite as fun as finding patterns within the things you memorize.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So all I have to do to memorize this one is remember, oh, seven and two is nine, I skip the next one, four and five is nine.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is almost like a sandwich. You just have to remember three, eight, four between the two ones.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
From one to one thousand, I can pinpoint any digit. So if you gave me like six hundred and eighty-seven, I'd be able to give you the six hundred and eighty-seven digit.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Being able to keep practicing that recall, I think, there are benefits of that, like, outside of just pi.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And so it helps me in class, because then I can just recall information.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My favorite number, over here, I don't think I have a supersonic brain.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think I have a pretty normal brain, but I've been able to kind of optimize these things.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I taught my friend how to memorize pi with the same explanation.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He was able to get to 200 digits in four days as a beginner. It works.
