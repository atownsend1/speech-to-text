0	8000	So I'm not really thinking here, I am just saying. 3.14159265358.
8000	19000	I can recite the first thousand digits or so in six minutes-ish, and then the next thousand digits, I was able to recite that in about 20 minutes.
19000	24000	Hi, my name is Annika and I'm a junior in bioengineering here at UMD.
24000	28000	I've really liked challenging myself to memorize things.
28000	35000	I remember my mother once spoke about someone who was able to memorize all the world capitals, and I was like, oh, that's cool, why don't I try that?
42000	48000	When I think about pi, you first have to structure it so that your brain can understand it.
48000	54000	These blocks are thousands. You split it into ten fractions, and these are the hundreds.
54000	67000	As opposed to trying to memorize things in one big sequence, I create a little matrix that I can individually put information in each one of those cells in my mind so I can recall it as I need to.
67000	73000	Then this hundred is split into tens, and then this ten is your digits.
73000	85000	When you're studying for a spelling test, for example, would it be easier to remember the spelling of a hundred letter word, or ten letter words, and the order of ten of those in a sentence?
85000	93000	I don't just rote-memorize anything, because I feel like that is not quite as fun as finding patterns within the things you memorize.
93000	102000	So all I have to do to memorize this one is remember, oh, seven and two is nine, I skip the next one, four and five is nine.
102000	108000	This is almost like a sandwich. You just have to remember three, eight, four between the two ones.
108000	118000	From one to one thousand, I can pinpoint any digit. So if you gave me like six hundred and eighty-seven, I'd be able to give you the six hundred and eighty-seven digit.
118000	124000	Being able to keep practicing that recall, I think, there are benefits of that, like, outside of just pi.
124000	129000	And so it helps me in class, because then I can just recall information.
129000	136000	My favorite number, over here, I don't think I have a supersonic brain.
136000	142000	I think I have a pretty normal brain, but I've been able to kind of optimize these things.
142000	145000	I taught my friend how to memorize pi with the same explanation.
145000	150000	He was able to get to 200 digits in four days as a beginner. It works.
